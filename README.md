# Java Plugins for Minecraft 1.14.4
A pack of two plugins for private class server with basic commands and entire guild plugin wrote from zero with our own vision.
## Commands
### It was here where I learned how to program in Java from scratch and the basics of writing in a yml file, which in the future allowed me to easily switch to JSON
## Guilds
### My first attempt at creating a larger project that required coming up with different solutions from scratch and writing in more that one file. While creating the so-called "plots" I had my first contact with documentation. The latest version of the plugin that I used in my guilds was completely new and completely written from scratch, and the documentation was the only source of changes at that time.
